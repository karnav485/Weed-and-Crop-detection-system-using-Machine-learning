# Weed-and-Crop-detection-system-using-Machine-learning
Created Weed (unwanted plants) and crop detection model using CNN and YOLOv3 algorithm using machine learning on agriculture image data. The aim of this project is to distinguish between weed and crop in agriculture farming and to minimize usage of fertilizers in farming. Technology used: CNN, YOLOv3, Python, Pytorch, Jupyter Lab.
